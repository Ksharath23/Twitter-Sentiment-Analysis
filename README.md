# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Libraries
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, nltk, re, wordcloud, gensim, scikit-learn, tensorflow

## Overview
*	Implemented sentiment analysis on twitter dataset which contains 1 lakh tweets. Preprocessed the text using NLTK and re libraries. Converted text to vectors using CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer and Word2Vec from Gensim Library. Applied ML Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost, LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM and compared their accuracy scores.
